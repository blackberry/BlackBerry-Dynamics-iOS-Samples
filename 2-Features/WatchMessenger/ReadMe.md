4. Launch Xcode and open the project.
5. Edit the *Bundle Identifier* to your own.
6. Edit the *URL identifier* and *URL Schemes* according to your own in the *info.plist*. See [Declaring a URL type to support BlackBerry Dynamics features](https://docs.blackberry.com/en/development-tools/blackberry-dynamics-sdk-ios/current/blackberry-dynamics-sdk-ios-devguide/gwj1489687014271) in the Developer Guide.
