# BlackBerry Dynamics Sample App for iOS - Swift

This sample pairs with Basic-iOS-Swift as examples of iOS apps before and after integrating with the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK. The two samples demostrate features commonly used in the BlackBerry Dynamics applications; secure file storage, secure database (SQL and CoreData), secure communication (HTTP/S and Socket) and a Data Loss Prevention Share View example.


## Requirements

See [Software Requirements](https://docs.blackberry.com/en/development-tools/blackberry-dynamics-sdk-ios/current/blackberry-dynamics-sdk-ios-devguide/gwj1489687014271/vcw1490294551674) of the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK (iOS) 



## How To Build and Deploy

1. Set up BlackBerry Dynamics Development Environment.
2. Clone the repo. 
3. Run `pod install` to create project workspace.
4. Launch Xcode and open the project.
5. Edit the *Bundle Identifier* to your own. 
6. Edit the *URL identifier* and *URL Schemes* according to your own in the *info.plist*. See [Declaring a URL type to support BlackBerry Dynamics features](https://docs.blackberry.com/en/development-tools/blackberry-dynamics-sdk-ios/current/blackberry-dynamics-sdk-ios-devguide/gwj1489687014271/rhn1489778136320)
7. Edit the *GDApplicationID* to your own in the *info.plist*.  
8. Add *BlackBerry Dynamics App entitlement* and *BlackBerry Dynamics entitlment version* to your UEM server. See [Add an internal BlackBerry Dynamics app entitlement](https://docs.blackberry.com/en/endpoint-management/blackberry-uem/current/administration/blackberry-dynamics/Adding-Dynamics-apps/zjx1471960344735) 
9. Assign the app entitlement to a user in your UEM server. 
10. Build, deploy and run on a testing device.

## How to test Share Sheet DLP Example

 `ShareViewController.swift`  is updated by `AppDelegate.swift` when changes to the users/app Dynamics Policy Configuration occur. 
 When `GDAppConfigKeyPreventDataLeakageIn` is `true`, the application cannot import data from other applications or services. 
 When `GDAppConfigKeyPreventDataLeakageOut` is `true`, the application cannot share data to other applications. 
 _[Documentation](https://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/files/blackberry-dynamics/ios/interface_g_di_o_s.html#a3265c6148406a8850ba673b26e472ece)_
 
 You can test this functionality by creating a `BlackBerry Dynamics Profile` under `Policies and Pofiles` in your UEM Console. Configure two profiles. One profile can be named as `Enabled DLP`, and the other,`Disable DLP`.

 You can assign different DLP settings to a test user after the application is activated. When the DLP setting is applied, you can navigate to the `ShareViewController.swift` on your app, and attempt to share under both cases.
